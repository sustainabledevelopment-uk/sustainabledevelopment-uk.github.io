For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  Taking the total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number of women with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.
