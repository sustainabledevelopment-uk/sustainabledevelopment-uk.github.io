It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.",

The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry. The measures are assessed as follows – A) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the exploitation level of stocks of UK interest with respect to the fishing mortality target FMSY. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below FMSY and reduce to zero the number of stocks of unknown status relative to FMSY. B) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.",
