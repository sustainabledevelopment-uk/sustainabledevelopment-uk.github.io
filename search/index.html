This means that we have to reformat data that is in a different format in order to make it usable on the site. We are looking to automate the process of updating the data we report. To do this we are working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which allows two software applications to communicate. APIs are commonly used by websites across the internet to automate updates and changes.\n\nOur aim is to use APIs that will work with data published online on a different website. For example, the ONS Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head time series has a supporting API which makes the data available in a format we can use.\n\nWe have written software program code to:\n\n  Enable our data site to link with APIs used by other websites reporting data\n  Calculate the relevant new figures\n  Format the results so they are usable on our site\n  Print our indicator files ready to go on our site\n\n\nWe are currently using APIs to update 15 different indicators. By automating these updates, we are able to report the latest data faster. To date we have concentrated on developing API communication with ONS websites. We are investigating which other websites we can connect to using APIs in the future.\n\nFor more information about the work we are doing with APIs, please  email us at SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk.\n","id":""},"/updates/2019/11/04/accessibility.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/updates/2019/11/04/accessibility.html","title":"Digital Accessibility Testing\n","content":"The commitment to “leave no one behind” is central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It extends to making our digital content accessible and functional for all users regardless of any disability or physical impairment.\n\n\n\nOur SDG data site is still in a testing phase, so we are using the ‘alpha’ label. We want to move the site to the next phase known as ‘beta’. Before we can label the site as beta it has to reach the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ‘AA’ standard, as well as other Government Digital Service criteria. This is a universally-recognised standard, designed to guarantee that assessed websites reach the predetermined accessibility criteria.\n\nWe updated some of the site’s features before it was tested, including:\n\n  making data tables and menus keyboard compatible\n  improving the high-contrast feature\n  adding descriptive labels and alternative text\n\n\nWe tested the improvements on a range of desktop and mobile devices using a variety of browsers and screen-readers.\nThe Digital Accessibility Centre tested the data site against the WCAG ‘AA’ standard in July 2019. The newly-accessible site was re-tested in July 2019 and passed, receiving ‘AA’ certification.\n\nWith ‘AA’ standard achieved, the UK SDG data site is now considered accessible to all users. A new code release (0.8.0) included these accessibility updates on the shared code repository ‘Open SDG’. This means that any country is able to use these updates.\n\nFor more information about what tools the site is compatible with and any know issues, see our accessibility statement, or please  email us at SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk.\n","id":""},"/updates/2019/11/04/funded-work.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/updates/2019/11/04/funded-work.html","title":"Funded work\n","content":"Our Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) project funds specific work across the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In this update those teams that receive SDG project funding explain the work they have been doing directly related to SDGs.\n\nONS Centre for Crime and Justice\nONS announced five centres focussing on key policy areas in 2018. Our [Centre for Crime and Justice] improves the understanding of the nature of crime.\n\nThis year, we reviewed all the ONS crime data used to report the SDG indicators. We have used the latest and the most appropriate data sources to update indicators as appropriate.\n\nA key focus for us has been investigating SDG indicators for which data is not provided. This includes indicators on modern slavery, human trafficking and child exploitation (Goal 16). We have made progress exploring new research methods and identifying potential data sources to support these indicators. We engaged with stakeholders from across government, academia and the third sector to help shape the research.\n\nONS Centre for Equalities and Inclusion\nOur Centre for Equalities and Inclusion was announced by ONS in 2018 too. We aim to work with others to ensure that the right data are available to address the main questions about fairness and equity in society.\n\nWe are working with the SDG team to develop the protected characteristics which align with the SDG disaggregations. New data sources and methods could benefit work programmes. They could also increase efforts for disadvantaged or discriminated groups.\n\nCentre for International Migration\nMigration is one of the main SDG disaggregations the United Nations requires countries to measure and report.\nThe Centre for International Migration has published a range of research outputs in the last year. The following research reports will provide input to SDG indicators. These reports give breakdowns by migratory status to provide evidence on the contribution that international migrants make to public services and the economy.\n\n\n  International migration and the education sector: This outlines the impact and contribution of international migration on the education sector at a local area. This will provide disaggregations for indicators within Goal 4: Quality Education.\n  International migration and the healthcare workforce: This draws on all available data on the migrant workforce in health care in the UK. This will provide a disaggregation for indicator 3.c.1; Health Worker density and distribution by migratory status.\n\n\nIn the coming year we will collaborate with colleagues across ONS to provide disaggregations for indicators related to birth rates and mortality using available data sources. We will also collaborate with colleagues from across the Government Statistical Service (GSS) to provide further disaggregations, specifically against Goal 4: Quality Education.\n\nTitchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated data\nIn March 2018 the UN Statistics Committee endorsed the Titchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated data. The main aim of our group is working with statistical organisations and others with a particular interest in ageing across the world to improve the measurement of ageing populations and older people. Age is one of the disaggregations required by the UN for measuring the SDGs. This is so that no one is left behind in progress towards the 2030 Agenda.\n\nWe discussed aligning our work to the SDGs at our second technical meeting in the Republic of Korea. The four objectives for this work strand are to:\n\n  assess the data available to monitor the “Leave No-one Behind” pledge\n  interface with the IAEG on SDG indicators and to identify data needs to monitor the SDG framework for older people\n  contribute to harmonisation and standards for producing ageing related data for disaggregation of SDG indicators\n  pilot innovative approaches to overcome challenges faced by NSOs in relation to availability and presentation of SDG data in relation to older people\n\n\nIn the past year we submitted a response to the Inter-Agency Expert Group (IAEG) for the SDGs 2020 indicator review. Over the coming year we will work on providing new age-related break downs of the SDG headline data for the UK.\n\nNatural Capital\nNatural Capital links economic and environmental data. We use the resulting statistics to estimate the value of the goods and services provided by nature in the UK. We also provide environmental statistical support to the ONS SDG Team.\n\nWe are developing statistics about where air temperature is cooled by trees and water. Our aim is to highlight inequalities between different geographical locations according to deprivation levels. This can inform sub-categories of headline environmental data reported about the SDGs in the UK.\n\nWe are supporting the improvement of data reported for SDG indicators about marine protection. For SDG target 14.7 (indicator 14.7.1) we are working on linking data about fish stock sustainability and the fishing economy.\n\nEnvironmental Accounts\nThe UK Environmental Accounts also link environmental and economic data. We have continued to help the ONS SDG team develop environmental related SDG indicators this year. We also highlighted the importance of SDG indicators within the UK Environmental Accounts in some publications.\n\nWe worked with the ONS SDG team to write our Greenhouse gas intensity, provisional estimates, UK: 2017 release. It highlighted SDG target 9.4 (indicator 9.4.1) about carbon dioxide emissions for which our data is used to report the UK SDG statistics.\n\nWe analysed the environmental impact of burning organic materials alongside its contribution to the UK’s renewable energy industry. Our article, A burning issue: biomass is the biggest source of renewable energy consumed in the UK highlighted SDG target 7.2 (indicator 7.2.1). We are working to provide sub-categories for UK SDG data about air emissions.\n\nWe worked with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the University of Leeds on Measuring material footprint in the UK: 2008 to 2016. The article presents updated estimates and discusses methodology for the UK’s material footprint. This work feeds into international decisions about the best methods for estimating material footprint. The data for the UK’s material footprint is used to report SDG targets 8.4 (indicator 8.4.1) and target 12.2 (indicator 12.2.1).\n\nGeospatial work in Data Architecture\nWe worked on a major cross-team project to produce data for how close people live to roads. The UK data is used to report SDG target 9.1 (indicator 9.1.1). Our project’s methodology can produce figures for every country in the world and was presented at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai. The project won the inaugural Government Science and Engineering Geography in Government Award. This work led to the World Bank reclassifying the indicator from Tier 3 to Tier 2. Tier 2 indicators have internationally established methodologies and standards available.\n\nWe are also sourcing data and analysing geographic data to tackle Goal 15 (indicators 15.1.1, 15.1.2 and 15.4.1.) Spatial disaggregation of forest area as a percentage of total land area (indicator 15.1.1) for the whole of UK is now available. This data is available at country and local authority level. It is available for years 2015 to 2017 for Great Britain and 2018 for Northern Ireland. Data showing the proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas (indicator 15.1.2) should follow shortly. We are also working on coverage by protected areas of important sites for biodiversity (indicator 15.4.1).\n\nWe carried out exploratory work on marine protected areas for SDG target 14.5 (indicator 14.5.1). We have also worked on national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches for SDG target 14.2 (indicator 14.2.1).\n\nFor more information about the work we are doing with other departments, please  email us at SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk.\n","id":""},"/updates/2019/11/04/international-work.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/updates/2019/11/04/international-work.html","title":"International work\n","content":"The Department for International Development (DfID) has partnered with countries in Africa and Asia and we receive funding from DfID  to support these countries with their SDG reporting. Our aim is to help improve the quality and availability of SDG data for these overseas partners.\n\nThe Open SDG software that we have used to build our SDG data site was developed by ONS in partnership with the Centre for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) and the United States Government. The software is open source and free to use, making it potentially accessible to all countries looking to create a data site to report their SDG data.\n\nWe have worked with three countries to help them create and use their own country’s data site. Ghana was the first country to copy the UK SDG data site. We held a workshop to help our colleagues from the Ghana Statistical Service set up their site and explained how to convert existing Ghana data into SDG indicator statistics.\n\nWe repeated the process with our colleagues in National Statistics Institute Rwanda. We helped them create their own SDG data site, upload data and explained how to maintain the site. Their experience is given as a case study to help other countries set up their own data site.\n\nWe also worked with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) to help the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. Other countries can also learn from their experience in a case study.\n\nAny country can create their own version of the SDG data site using step-by-step online instructions. Over ten countries have copied the site without direct help, to date.\n\nSome countries choose to customise their site. For example, Kazakhstan has added visuals to their homepage. Armenia has added targets as well as indicators and reports national indicators.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals promote the idea of collaboration. With that in mind, it is important to make sure the SDG community shares new developments. Open SDG shares   software program code for additions, amendments and new features.It is a shared, open-source online GitHub resource. SDG community members can use the program code stored on the site to amend SDG data sites. The community encourages members to submit and review feature updates.\n\nCountries can copy the  Open SDG to create a new data site from scratch. The Open SDG releases incorporate any revised or new features. These include:\n\n  data visualisations\n  accessibility improvements\n  language translations\n  reporting status categories\n\n\nOpen SDG has provided updates to available features following requests from community members. Recent new program code allows people to mark SDG indicators as ‘not applicable’, for example.\n\nWe are working with CODE and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) to develop a way to use data and metadata in SDMX format. We have fixed various data visualisation bugs particularly in relation to maps. We also and added language translations in German, Spanish, French, Russian, Kazakh, Armenian and Arabic.\n\nFor more information about the international work we are doing, please  email us at SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk.\n","id":""},"/updates/2020/03/06/IWD-2020.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/updates/2020/03/06/IWD-2020.html","title":"Celebrating International Women’s Day 2020\n","content":"In celebration of International Women’s Day on Sunday (8th March), we have looked at what the UK SDG data says about the experience of women in the UK today.\n\n\n  The percentage of women in management positions in the UK increased between 2013 and 2017 and is highest in younger women. In 2017, 48% of 16 to 24-year olds in managerial positions were women. This is compared with 38% in the 45 to 54 age group.\n  In the last quarter of 2019, the percentage of young women who were not in education, employment or training in the UK was lower than men. The annual decrease of 43,000 in 2019 in the amount of young women in this situation, was the largest since July to September 2017 and the level reached a record low.\n  In the UK in 2019 the proportion of men who had recently used the internet was higher than women, although this difference has reduced since 2011. In 2019 this difference was driven by those in the oldest age groups. For example, 54% of men aged 75 and over were recent internet users, compared with 41% of women in this age group.\n  Female representation in the House of Commons has been increasing since 1997. The last official figures were reported before the 2019 general election. The House of Commons Library reported that a record 211 (32%) of MPs were women having risen from 27.8% in 1997. More female MPs (220) were elected in December 2019 but those figures have yet to be reported officially.\n  More girls than boys reach the learning standards expected for under 5 year olds in England (according to the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)). In 2018 77% of girls in England reached at least the “expected” level compared with 63% of boys.\n\n\nThe SDGs framework gives a picture of the UK across a broad range of issues in one place. We are looking to collect more data to go beyond the headline measures to show how the issues they cover effect different groups of the population. The Goals aim to “leave no one behind” and the ONS has committed to the Inclusive Data Charter which encourages an aim to break down headline data wherever possible, including by sex.\n\nAt ONS we are pulling together data from across Government and the country to do this.  Currently, the UK reports data for 77% of the 244 Sustainable Development Goals indicators.\n\nWe are working to find the best data and are experimenting to see where new statistics need to be created.

We are working with colleagues across the Government Statistical Service to do this, including the Data Science Campus.\n\nWe published our response to the consultation on measuring and reporting SDGs in the UK where we asked for your ideas on prioritising data development. Your feedback informed our data development plans.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nWe have used two different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:\n\n\n  \n    Reported online – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregation’s\n  \n  \n    Exploring data sources – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator\n  \n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nWho uses this website?\nAn initial phase of user research has been carried out on the UK SDG data website.

They will often copy the data directly from the tables rather than download it and will often transform the data for others.\n\nWe must:\n\n\n  give them advanced routes in to the data from the outset\n  show them the targets\n  show relationships between different indicators\n  give them methodology behind the data\n  tell them if the data is comparable with other SDG data\n\n\nWe must not:\n\n\n  put lots of commentary and top-level visualisations in their way\n  make it hard to get lots of data\n  expect them to navigate each indicator to geth the data they need\n  expect them to understand the difference between data on the UK NRP and the UN global database\n\n\nBack to top\n","id":""},"/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/","title":"17 goals to transform our world\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/goals/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/goals/","title":"UK data for the Sustainable Development Goals\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/reporting-status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/reporting-status/","title":"Reporting Status\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/indicators.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/indicators.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/search/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/search/","title":"Search results\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/8-6-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/8-6-1","title":"Indicator 8.6.1 - Proportion of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training","content":"Further disaggregation by ethnicity are available from Ethnicity facts and figures.

In 2016 the figure stood at 35%.\n\n•\tNorthern Ireland’s female Assembly Members rose from 13% in 1998 to 30% in 2017.\n\nSee the House of Commons Library Briefing Paper for more information.\n","id":"5.5.1","graph_title":"Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and local governments\n"},"/7-1-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/7-1-1","title":"Indicator 7.1.1 - Proportion of population with access to electricity","content":"\n","id":"7.1.1","graph_title":"Percentage of population with access to electricity\n","data_keywords":"Electricity, Energy, Access\n"},"/16-6-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/16-6-1","title":"Indicator 16.6.1 - Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","content":"\n","id":"16.6.1","graph_title":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)\n","data_keywords":"\n"},"/7-a-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/7-a-1","title":"Indicator 7.a.1 - International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems","content":"\n","id":"7.a.1","indicator_available":"Net Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems\n","graph_title":"Net ODA in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production (£000s)\n","data_keywords":"ODA\n"},"/17-3-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/17-3-1","title":"Indicator 17.3.1 - Foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance and South-South cooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget","content":"\n","id":"17.3.1","graph_title":"Foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance and South-South cooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget\n","data_keywords":"\n"},"/16-2-2":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/16-2-2","title":"Indicator 16.2.2 - Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by sex, age and form of exploitation","content":"Modern slavery is a complex crime that covers all forms of slavery, trafficking and exploitation. Currently, there is no definitive source of data or suitable method available to accurately quantify the number of victims of offences that fall under modern slavery in the UK. The hidden nature of the crime makes producing an accurate prevalence measure difficult. Instead, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has brought together a range of available data sources on known victims and cases of modern slavery to provide a better understanding of the extent and nature of the crime. See the Modern slavery in the UK - March 2020 article and appendix tables for the data.\n\nKey findings from the article include -\n\n  Greater awareness, increases in reporting and improvements in police recording are likely to have contributed to the increases seen in potential victim numbers in the UK since the introduction of the modern slavery Acts across the UK in 2015.\n  The number of potential victims referred through the UK National Referral Mechanism (NRM) increased by 36% to 6,985 in the year ending December 2018. Almost half of the referrals (45%) were potential victims aged under 18 years (see Appendix table 1). (Source - Home Office – UK)\n  In the year ending June 2019, 55% of potential adult victims supported in England and Wales were female and 44% were male (see Appendix table 36). The type of exploitation experienced varied by sex of victim. For example, in the year ending June 2019, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation were predominantly experienced by females (83% and 98% respectively), whereas labour exploitation was mostly experienced by males (86%) (see Figure 7 of the article and Appendix table 39). (Source - The Salvation Army - England and Wales).\n\n\nProfessor Sir Bernard Silverman, a leading academic in the field of modern slavery, has also published a supporting blog on Understanding the nature of modern slavery in the UK.\n","id":"16.2.2","graph_title":"Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by sex, age and form of exploitation\n"},"/15-2-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/15-2-1","title":"Indicator 15.2.1 - Progress towards sustainable forest management","content":"\n","id":"15.2.1","graph_title":"Progress towards sustainable forest management\n","data_keywords":"forest, sustainability, forests, sustainable, woodland\n"},"/1-5-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/1-5-1","title":"Indicator 1.5.1 - Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","content":"\n","id":"1.5.1","indicator_available":"Number of deaths attributed to disasters per 100,000 population\n","graph_title":"Deaths from exposure to natural forces per 100,000 population and number of deaths.\n","data_keywords":"Deaths, Natural Forces\n"},"/1":{"type":"Goals","url":"/1","title":"Goal 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere","content":"","id":"1"},"/2":{"type":"Goals","url":"/2","title":"Goal 2 - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture","content":"","id":"2"},"/3":{"type":"Goals","url":"/3","title":"Goal 3 - Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","content":"","id":"3"},"/4":{"type":"Goals","url":"/4","title":"Goal 4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all","content":"","id":"4"},"/5":{"type":"Goals","url":"/5","title":"Goal 5 - Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls","content":"","id":"5"},"/6":{"type":"Goals","url":"/6","title":"Goal 6 - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all","content":"","id":"6"},"/7":{"type":"Goals","url":"/7","title":"Goal 7 - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all","content":"","id":"7"},"/8":{"type":"Goals","url":"/8","title":"Goal 8 - Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","content":"","id":"8"},"/9":{"type":"Goals","url":"/9","title":"Goal 9 - Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","content":"","id":"9"},"/10":{"type":"Goals","url":"/10","title":"Goal 10 - Reduce inequality within and among countries","content":"","id":"10"},"/11":{"type":"Goals","url":"/11","title":"Goal 11 - Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","content":"","id":"11"},"/12":{"type":"Goals","url":"/12","title":"Goal 12 - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns","content":"","id":"12"},"/13":{"type":"Goals","url":"/13","title":"Goal 13 - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts","content":"","id":"13"},"/14":{"type":"Goals","url":"/14","title":"Goal 14 - Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","content":"","id":"14"},"/15":{"type":"Goals","url":"/15","title":"Goal 15 - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","content":"","id":"15"},"/16":{"type":"Goals","url":"/16","title":"Goal 16 - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","content":"","id":"16"},"/17":{"type":"Goals","url":"/17","title":"Goal 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development","content":"","id":"17"}};
