            Units of direct energy used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA values.

            Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary energy supply over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined by the IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
