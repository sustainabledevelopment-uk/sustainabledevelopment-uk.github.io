            Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum of the value added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as well as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at constant prices.
