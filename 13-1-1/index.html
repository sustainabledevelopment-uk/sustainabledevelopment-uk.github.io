            Data is provided by the Nomis Mortality Statistics dataset. This dataset provides mortality statistics for England and Wales, broken down by calendar year of registration, age, sex, underlying cause of death  (classified using ICD10, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) and area of usual residence of the deceased. Death statistics are compiled from information supplied when deaths are certified and registered as part of civil registration, a legal requirement. Figures represent the number of deaths registered in the calendar year. Figures represent deaths which occurred in England and Wales - these include the deaths of individuals whose usual residence was outside England and Wales.
